Project language file 2
==============

For Seanpm2001/LearnPython
-----------------

The second project language file for this project is ReStructuredText, as this project (Seanpm2001/LearnPython) focuses directly on content written in Python, and it is only appropriate to use Pythons own markup language for documentation, so it is a secondary language.

This is a rare instance in which I am using ReStructuredText as a project language. If you want to do the same for your project, add this to your ``.gitattributes`` file

*.md linguist-detectable=true

*.md linguist-documentation=false

Advanced version:
-----------------

# Markdown (*.md, *.mkd, *.markdown)

*.md linguist-detectable=true

*.md linguist-documentation=false

*.mkd linguist-detectable=true

*.mkd linguist-documentation=false

*.markdown linguist-detectable=true

*.markdown linguist-documentation=false
